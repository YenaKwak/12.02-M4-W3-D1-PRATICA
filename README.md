## UPDATE An online book marketplace | JavaScript | Fetch | API
<br>
- a homepage showing all the books with bootstrap cards<br>
- a section for the cart<br>
- a text input to search for books<br><br>
Render all books using literals and .forEach or .map templates<br>
Make sure there is an "Add to cart" button inside each card<br>
<br>
When the button is clicked<br>
1. Add the book to your cart list<br>
2. Change the card style to show that it has already been added<br><br>


Add text input that works like a search bar. When the user writes more than 3 characters,
it filters the API result to render only books with a title that matches, even partially, the content of the input.
<br>

Add a "skip" button on all cards, when clicked, it should make the card disappear.<br>
Create a "details" page. by clicking on a third button on the card.<br>
the user should be taken to a separate html page where you will see the details of the book.
